# My JavaScript Library

## Description

Welcome to my JavaScript library! This project showcases my custom-built library that includes my own implementations of array and string functions, sorting algorithms, and mathematical algorythms. The goal of this project is to demonstrate my low-code programming skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

There are over 70 functions some of them are:
### Euclidean Algorithms
- **myEuclideanAlgorithm**: An algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
- 
### Array Functions

- **`myMap`**: A custom implementation of the `map` function for arrays.
- **`myFilter`**: A custom implementation of the `filter` function for arrays.
- **`myReduce`**: A custom implementation of the `reduce` function for arrays.

### String Functions

- **`myTrim`**: A custom implementation of the `trim` function to remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string.
- **`myIncludes`**: A custom implementation of the `includes` function to check if a string contains a specified substring.

### Sorting Algorithms

- **myBubbleSort**: A classic sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **myInsertionSort**: A sorting algorithm that builds the sorted array one item at a time, by comparing and inserting elements into the correct position.
- **myQuickSort**: An efficient sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer principle to sort elements.
